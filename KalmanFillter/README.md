# Sensor Fusion — Kalman Filter and Object Tracking Overview

This section focuses on building real-time object tracking systems using Kalman Filters and multi-sensor fusion techniques. 
---

## Overview

### **L1: Kalman Filters**
Learn directly from **Sebastian Thrun**, who walks you through:
- The concepts behind Kalman Filters  
- How they predict and update object states  
- Implementing a Kalman Filter in **Python**  
This lesson builds the foundation for sensor fusion tracking.

---

### **L2: Lidar and Radar Fusion with Kalman Filters in C++**
Build a high-performance Kalman Filter in **C++** capable of fusing:
- Lidar measurements  
- Radar measurements  

Why C++?  
Because real-time tracking systems depend on the speed and efficiency provided by compiled languages.  
By the end of this lesson, you'll have a multi-sensor fusion pipeline capable of consistent, real-time object tracking.
