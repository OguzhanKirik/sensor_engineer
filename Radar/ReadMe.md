## Overview

### **L1: Radar Principles Review**
Learn the foundational concepts behind radar systems, including:
- Radar functionality and operating principles  
- FMCW (Frequency-Modulated Continuous Wave) waveforms  
- Radar hardware components and architecture  
- Radar system schematics  
- The Radar Range Equation and power relationships  

---

### **L2: Range-Doppler Estimation**
Perform signal processing steps to estimate:
- **Range** of a target using beat frequencies  
- **Radial velocity** using Doppler shift  
Includes generation of Range FFT and Range-Doppler Maps (RDM).

### **L3: Clutter, CFAR, AoA, and Clustering**
Dive into more advanced radar perception techniques:
- Understanding clutter and how it forms  
- Removing clutter using **CFAR (Constant False Alarm Rate)** detection  
- **Angle of Arrival (AoA)** estimation using antenna arrays  
- Performing clustering on radar detections for object grouping
