1DCfar Practice

This repository contains MATLAB scripts focused on radar signal processing, including target generation, detection, Doppler estimation, and range analysis.

Files Included

Radar_Target_Generation_and_Detection.m
Generates FMCW radar target signals and performs detection using range and Doppler processing.

doppler_estimation.m
Script or functions for estimating the Doppler shift to determine target velocity.

estimate_frequency_shifts.m
Calculates frequency shifts in received radar signals, supporting beat-frequency or Doppler analysis.

estimate_max_range.m
Computes the maximum detectable range of a radar system based on system parameters.
